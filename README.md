# gradle-changelog-plugin

## Description

This is a Gradle plugin that generates changelog entries from Git commits. Yes, I know what the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) guys say. I understand that point of view, but I think if
humans can write meaningful
changelog entries in a Markdown document, they can also write meaningful commits. Furthermore, I think it's
better if a CHANGELOG accurately reflects Git history and vice-versa.

## Usage

## Integrating with Git hooks

## Future work

- [ ] Task option to "publish" a release
